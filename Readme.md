# hfind

## A GNU-find based tool written in Haskell

This is a tool based on the GNU-find utility which allow user to search for files in a directory hierarchy, based on their filename or extension.

This tool is very simple to use. Just call it and give it a path where to search, and a filename or a extension to search for.

This utility allows user to execute a shell command which takes a filaname path at the end of the order (like "rm"), since the tool concatenates the order with the result of the search.
